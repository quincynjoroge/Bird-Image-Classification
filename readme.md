## Overview
Bird conservation is a field in the science of conservation biology related to threatened birds. Humans have had a profound effect on many bird species. Over one hundred species have gone extinct in historical times, although the most dramatic human-caused extinctions occurred in the Pacific Ocean as humans colonised the islands of Melanesia, Polynesia and Micronesia, during which an estimated 750â€“1,800 species of birds became extinct. According to Worldwatch Institute, many bird populations are currently declining worldwide with 1,200 species facing extinction in the next century.

We therefore decided to classify six different classes of birds and further develop a model that will predict the six classes of birds.

This analysis seeks to aid in the bird conservation efforts by building a model that can identify and classify various spicies of birds. This will help in identifying their habitats so that they can be protected.



### Our Metric for success
Being able to correctly predict bird images by building a machine learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks.

We will then decide which of the models will be most suitable for prediction by evaluating the models accuracy.
